# Physics project about diffusion
Hello, guysüñêüèª

Today I want to get you acquainted with my application. 
This application models diffusion in liquids and gases.

The program works in the following way:

  - At the beginning, you should choose the model. There are two models (gases & liquids).

  - Next, you should set all of options (colorsüåà, the ratio of substance and so on).

  - Finaly, you have two options: draw the graph of entropy or the graph of diffusion.

Also you have some helpfull options: 

  - Speed up process of visualization‚è©.

  - Add new substance‚ûï.

  - Stop process‚õî.
